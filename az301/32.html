The system has three tiers: a front-end web app, a middle-tier web API, and a back-end data store implemented as a Microsoft SQL Server 2014 database. All servers run Windows Server 2012 R2.<br>The front-end and middle-tier components are hosted by using Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The application code is written in C# and ASP.NET.<br>The middle-tier API uses the Entity Framework to communicate to the SQL Server database. Maintenance of the database is performed by using SQL Server<br>Agent jobs.<br>The database is currently 2 TB and is not expected to grow beyond 3 TB.<br>The payment processing system has the following compliance-related requirements:<br> Encrypt data in transit and at rest. Only the front-end and middle-tier components must be able to access the encryption keys that protect the data store.<br> Keep backups of the data in two separate physical locations that are at least 200 miles apart and can be restored for up to seven years.<br>Support blocking inbound and outbound traffic based on the source IP address, the destination IP address, and the port number.<br><img src="./32_files/0009200003.png" class="in-exam-image"><br> Collect Windows security logs from all the middle-tier servers and retain the logs for a period of seven years.<br> Inspect inbound and outbound traffic from the front-end tier by using highly available network appliances.<br> Only allow all access to all the tiers from the internal network of Contoso.<br>Tape backups are configured by using an on-premises deployment of Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM), and then shipped offsite for long term storage.<br>Historical Transaction Query System<br>Contoso recently migrated a business-critical workload to Azure. The workload contains a .NET web service for querying the historical transaction data residing in<br>Azure Table Storage. The .NET web service is accessible from a client app that was developed in-house and runs on the client computers in the New York office.<br>The data in the table storage is 50 GB and is not expected to increase.<br><br>Current Issues -<br>The Contoso IT team discovers poor performance of the historical transaction query system, at the queries frequently cause table scans.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>Planned Changes -<br>Contoso plans to implement the following changes:<br> Migrate the payment processing system to Azure.<br> Migrate the historical transaction data to Azure Cosmos DB to address the performance issues.<br><br>Migration Requirements -<br>Contoso identifies the following general migration requirements:<br> Infrastructure services must remain available if a region or a data center fails. Failover must occur without any administrative intervention.<br> Whenever possible, Azure managed services must be used to minimize management overhead.<br> Whenever possible, costs must be minimized.<br>Contoso identifies the following requirements for the payment processing system:<br> If a data center fails, ensure that the payment processing system remains available without any administrative intervention. The middle-tier and the web front end must continue to operate without any additional configurations.<br> Ensure that the number of compute nodes of the front-end and the middle tiers of the payment processing system can increase or decrease automatically based on CPU utilization.<br> Ensure that each tier of the payment processing system is subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99 percent availability.<br>Minimize the effort required to modify the middle-tier API and the back-end tier of the payment processing system.<br><img src="./32_files/0009300012.png" class="in-exam-image"><br> Generate alerts when unauthorized login attempts occur on the middle-tier virtual machines.<br> Ensure that the payment processing system preserves its current compliance status.<br> Host the middle tier of the payment processing system on a virtual machine.<br>Contoso identifies the following requirements for the historical transaction query system:<br> Minimize the use of on-premises infrastructure services.<br> Minimize the effort required to modify the .NET web service querying Azure Cosmos DB.<br> Minimize the frequency of table scans.<br> If a region fails, ensure that the historical transactions query system remains available without any administrative intervention.<br>Information Security Requirements<br>The IT security team wants to ensure that identity management is performed by using Active Directory. Password hashes must be stored on-premises only.<br>Access to all business-critical systems must rely on Active Directory credentials. Any suspicious authentication attempts must trigger a multi-factor authentication prompt automatically. legitimate users must be able to authenticate successfully by using multi-factor authentication.
